Hello,

I'm an Austin, TX based developer with 12 years of professional development experience. I've been working with Laravel, Vue, MySQL, and AWS for the vast majority of my career. I also have significant enterprise level experience with MongoDB and other document databases.

Attached is my resume. I'm very excited to talk with the LenderHomePage team and learn more about the company culture and opportunity.

Thank you,

Thomas Kane
